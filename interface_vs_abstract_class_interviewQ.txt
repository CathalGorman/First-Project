interface vs abstract class.

Both are abstract types but they have fundamentaly different usages.
An interface is just a role that any class can play and is not tied to any specific .
An abstract class is tied to heirarchy and is the base class of a whole heirarchy it can have a 
mix of abstract and implememnted and its function is to define the state and behaviour of a whole heirarchy.
