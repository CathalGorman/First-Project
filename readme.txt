I created a login page which grants access to the Council Homepage. (validated with javascript)
	
	Username: Admin
	Password: Cathal
	
From the Homepage each individual table in database can be retrieved by searching table names.
e.g equipment, tenants, property, repairs and tradesmen.

Javascript is used for validation of all primary keys except for equipment page which just uses HTML5.
	
I used my equipment page for my insert and select to database. The Search bar can be used to search the 
table by equipment-id e.g(112).

I changed the colour of the text from design document.

The exported database will not work without first creating councildatabase in localhost 
and importing into this database.(could not figure this out).
