For the tenant table I took it from the narative that not all tenants will have a registration number 
so that can't be used as a primary key.

The exported database will not work without first creating councildatabase in localhost 
and importing into this database.Please create a database name 
and import councildatabase.sql (this is only one which will imprt correctly).



councildatabase1.sql is database before codds rules changes are made.

testdata.sql has test data

DatabaseTables.sql has just the tables and keys
